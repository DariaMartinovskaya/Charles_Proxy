# Charles Proxy

Charles is an HTTP proxy that enables testers to view all of the HTTP and SSL / HTTPS traffic between their machine and the Internet. This includes requests, responses and the HTTP headers (which contain the cookies and caching information).

Chatles' main tools are:
- Breakpoints that allows to pause the request before it reaches the server. By means of breakpoints we are able to analyze and modify requests in more detail.
- Rewrite that enables to create rules that modify requests and responses as they pass through Charles. Rules such as adding or changing a header or search and replace some text in the response body.
- Bandwidth Throttle / Bandwidth Simulator can be used to adjust the bandwidth and latency of your Internet connection. This enables to simulate modem conditions using your high-speed connection.
